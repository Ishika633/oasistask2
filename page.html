      <p class="about">
        A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born
        October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong),
        Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the
        development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was
        president of India from 2002 to 2007. Kalam earned a degree in
        aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in
        1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In
        1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was
        project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that
        was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam
        planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which
        helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was
        Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which
        incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.

      <p class="about">
        Kalam received 7 honorary doctorates from 40 universities.[150][151] The
        Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 1981 and the
        Padma Vibhushan in 1990 for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as
        a scientific advisor to the Government.[152] In 1997, Kalam received
        India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution
        to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in
        India.[153] In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from
        the National Space Society "to recognize excellence in the management
        and leadership of a space-related project".[154] In 2012, Kalam was
        ranked number 2 in Outlook India's poll of the Greatest Indian.[155]
        Following his death, Kalam received numerous tributes. The Tamil Nadu
        state government announced that his birthday, 15 October, would be
        observed across the state as "Youth Renaissance Day;" the state
        government further instituted the "Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Award",
        constituting an 8-gram gold medal, a certificate and ₹500,000
        (US$6,300). The award will be awarded annually on Independence Day,
        beginning in 2015, to residents of the state with achievements in
        promoting scientific growth, the humanities or the welfare of students

    <h3>Writings</h3>
    <div class="first">
      <img id="wr" src="writing.jpg" />
      <p class="about">
        In his book India 2020, Kalam strongly advocated an action plan to
        develop India into a "knowledge superpower" and a developed nation by
        2020. He regarded his work on India's nuclear weapons programme as a way
        to assert India's place as a future superpower.[147] I have identified
        five areas where India has a core competence for integrated action: (1)
        agriculture and food processing; (2) education and healthcare; (3)
        information and communication technology; (4) infrastructure, reliable
        and quality electric power, surface transport and infrastructure for all
        parts of the country; and (5) self-reliance in critical technologies.
        These five areas are closely inter-related and if advanced in a
        coordinated way, will lead to food, economic and national security.
        Kalam describes a "transformative moment" in his life when he asked
        Pramukh Swami, the guru of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sampradaya, how India
        might realise this five-pronged vision of development. Pramukh Swami's
        answer—to add a sixth area developing faith in God and spirituality to
        overcome the current climate of crime and corruption—became the
        spiritual vision for the next 15 years Kalam's life, which he describes
        in his final book, Transcendence: My Spiritual Experiences with Pramukh
        Swamiji, published just a month before his death
